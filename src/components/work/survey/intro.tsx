            Accurate land records are the foundation of transparent governance,
            efficient infrastructure planning, and sustainable development. At
            SR Asia, we specialize in Digital Land Surveying using Differential
            Global Positioning System (DGPS) and GIS technologies to deliver
            high-precision, reliable, and verifiable land data for governments,
            corporates, and community stakeholders.

            Our work with the Revenue & Land Settlement Department, Government
            of Mizoram, has demonstrated our ability to carry out large-scale,
            scientifically robust land surveys that strengthen land governance,
            support planning, and safeguard the rights of stakeholders.
