            At SR Asia, we carry out{" "}
            <strong>Need Assessment Surveys (NAS)</strong>
            and <strong>Social Impact Evaluations (SIE)</strong> to understand
            community needs and measure the outcomes of CSR interventions. NAS
            identifies critical gaps in infrastructure, health, education, and
            livelihoods while SIE evaluates the effectiveness of programs in
            improving the quality of life. These processes ensure CSR projects
            are evidence-based, participatory, and aligned with long-term
            community development goals.
